# To Do App

My React "To Do" app refactored with Redux

[See it live](https://druserkes.github.io/todo-list-redux/)

### Getting started
1. Clone this repo
2. npm install
3. npm start

*That's it!*

### Features 
* Users can create a To Do
* Users can edit a To Do 
* Clicking a To Do marks it complete, and crosses it off 
* Users can remove a To Do 
* To Do items persist between sessions and work with same items as my [other To Do list app](https://github.com/DruSerkes/Todo-list)

### Tech
* React
* Redux
* localStorage 😅👍

###### *This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*
